# Playwright

## Overview

Playwright uses a low-level protocol to provide access to implementation details of the application under test.
It allows setting event listeners to take specific actions when certain criteria are met 
(e.g., whenever the app requests to load an image asset, tell it to display a kitten photo instead).
It is primarily written in JavaScript, but provides support for Java, Python and C# as well.
The primary limitation currently is that it does not work with the production version of browsers, 
which means tests must be executed against a modified copy of the latest open source version 
of the desired browser. These custom browsers must be downloaded with each new version of Playwright.
This is especially limiting for browsers like Safari, which is quite distinct from the available open source Webkit code.

## Playwright on Sauce Labs

There are 3 ways to execute Playwright tests with Sauce Labs, and this project demonstrates running
the same tests with each approach. You can run these tests by cloning the repo and navigating to this directory. 
Ensure you [set the environment variables](https://docs.saucelabs.com/basics/environment-variables/),
and run:
```bash
npm install 
```

### Saucectl

* **Purpose**: Execute Playwright tests written in JavaScript on any Sauce Labs platform configuration.
* **Use Case**: Ideal for running cross-browser/cross-platform tests without maintaining local environments.
* **Reference**: https://docs.saucelabs.com/web-apps/automated-testing/playwright/

For more information on the saucectl product, read the [saucectl documentation](https://docs.saucelabs.com/dev/cli/saucectl/).
For a more thorough demonstration of ways to use playwright with saucectl, take a look at the 
[Saucectl Playwright Example Repo](https://github.com/saucelabs/saucectl-playwright-example). 

To execute Playwright with saucectl from this directory, run: 
```bash
npm run test.saucectl 
```

### Remote Grid

* **Purpose**: Execute Playwright tests in any [suppported language](https://playwright.dev/docs/languages) 
by connecting to a remote Selenium Grid.
* **Use Case**: Suitable for developers comfortable configuring custom code environments 
and seeking detailed command execution logs. This solution is limited to testing Chrome and Microsoft Edge.
* **Reference**: https://playwright.dev/docs/selenium-grid

To execute Playwright with a remote grid from this directory, run:
```bash
npm run test.grid 
```

### Playwright Reporter

* **Purpose**: Execute Playwright tests locally and display detailed reports on Sauce Labs.
* **Use Case**: Best for executing JavaScript-based Playwright tests on local machines when cross-platform testing is not needed.
* **Reference**: https://docs.saucelabs.com/web-apps/automated-testing/playwright/

To execute Playwright with the playwright reporter from this directory, run:
```bash
npm run test.reporter 
```
