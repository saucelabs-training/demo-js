- [iOS real devices on the new Sauce Labs UI](#run-tests-on-sauce-labs-ios-real-devices-in-the-new-sauce-labs-ui)

> NOTE: this feature is **NOT** supported for emulators and simulators!!

## Install dependencies
You can install all dependencies by running the following command

    npm install

This will install all needed dependencies that are listed in the `package.json`-file

> NOTE: Make sure you are in the folder `webdriverio/appium-app/examples/image-injection` when you execute this command

## Important information
### Environment variables for Sauce Labs
The examples in this repository that can run on Sauce Labs use environment variables, make sure you've added the following

    # For Sauce Labs Real devices in the New UI
    export SAUCE_USERNAME=********
    export SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY=*******

### Demo app(s)
The demo app that has been used for all these tests can be found [here](https://github.com/saucelabs/sample-app-mobile/releases).
Be aware of the fact that you need the build for the iOS real device. So please check the file you download.

> The advice is to download the files to an `apps` folder in the root of this folder.

### Upload apps to Sauce Storage
If you want to use Android emulators, iOS simulators or iOS real devices in the New Sauce Labs UI you need to upload the apps to the Sauce Storage.
You can find a script to upload them to, or the US, or EU DC in [this](scripts)-folder. You can push the files to the 
storage by doing the following from the root of this folder:

    cd scripts
    ./push_apps_to_storage.sh
    
When you've done that you will see for example the following logs

    ➜  scripts git:(master) ✗ ./push_apps_to_storage.sh
