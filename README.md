>  [![Open in Gitpod](https://github.com/saucelabs-training/demo-js/blob/master/open-in-gitpod.png)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/saucelabs-training/demo-js)
>
>   After the gitpod session launches, navigate to the terminal and run the following commands to save your [Sauce Labs Credentials](https://app.saucelabs.com/user-settings) to gitpod as environment variables:
>   ```
>   eval $(gp env -e SAUCE_USERNAME=******)
>   eval $(gp env -e SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY=******)
>   ```
>   Click the following link if you're unsure how to [access your Sauce Labs credentials.](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/display/DOCS/Best+Practice%3A+Use+Environment+Variables+for+Authentication+Credentials)
>   Also, if you start a new terminal in gitpod, you have to run the following command to reset envrionment variables:
>   ```
>   eval $(gp env -e)
>   ```
>  
>   For more information consult the [gitpod documentation](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/47_environment_variables/)
